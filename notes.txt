**Online Library System**:

# **Project Requirement Document**  
## **1. Project Overview**  
**Project Name:** Online Library Management System  
**Objective:** To develop an online system that tracks borrowed books, manages stock availability, designates return times, and handles borrowing fees for non-members.  

## **2. Functional Requirements**  
### **User Management**  
- Allow user registration with credentials: **Name, Email, Password, Date Joined, User Type**  
- Categorize users as **Members** or **Librarians**  
- Implement borrowing restrictions based on user type  
- Charge non-members a **borrow fee** that is returned upon book return  

### **Book Management**  
- Store book details: **Book ID, Title, Author, Publisher, Total Copies**  
- Track individual book copies and their availability  
- Organize books by categories using **Category ID**  
- Manage book states (Available, Borrowed, Lost, etc.)  

### **Borrowing and Loan System**  
- Members can borrow books with conditions on **Return Date**  
- Librarians authorize book loans and returns  
- Track loan transactions with **Loan Number, Loan Date, Return Date, Late Fees, and Payment Status**  
- Implement electronic signature validation for borrowers and returners  
- Monitor **Late Fees, Amount Retained, and Amount Returned**  

## **3. Database Design**  
### **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**  
- **User** (user_id, name, email, password, joined date, user_type)  
- **Book** (book_id, title, author, publisher, total copies)  
- **Category** (cat_id, category name)  
- **Book_Copy** (book_id, copy_num, state)  
- **Borrow** (member_id, book_id, copy_num, borrow_date, return_date, librarian_id)  
- **Loan** (book_id, copy_num, loan_num, loan_date, return_date, late_fee, amount_retained, amount_returned, loan_distributor, borrower_esign, returner_esign, return_authorizor)  

### **Relational Notation**  
- Foreign keys ensure referential integrity (e.g., **Member_ID references User_ID**)  
- **Primary Key Constraints** enforce data uniqueness  
- **Transaction Tables** (Borrow, Loan) track borrowing activities  

## **4. System Features**  
- **Member and Librarian Dashboard** for managing book loans  
- **Book Inventory Management** with availability tracking  
- **Automated Return Date Calculation**  
- **Late Fee Processing and Borrow Fee Handling**  
- **Audit Logging** for borrowing history  

## **5. Security and Compliance**  
- Secure **user authentication and role-based access**  
- Validate electronic signatures for borrowing and returning books  
- Implement **data encryption** for sensitive information  

## **6. Performance Requirements**  
- System should support **multiple concurrent users**  
- Database queries should **execute efficiently** to minimize load times  
- Ensure **high availability and reliability** for book tracking  

## **7. Assumptions and Constraints**  
- Users must have an **active membership** to borrow books without fees  
- A book copy can be borrowed **only if available** in stock  
- Late fees will be **automatically calculated** based on return delays
